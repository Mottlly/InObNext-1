            After the resource wars of the late 21st Century, Earth's nations
            are desperate for new deposits of rare minerals, gas, and water.
            While asteroid mining has been effective, it just isn't enough to
            support the Earth's still-growing population (and many refuse to
            speak about what happened on Mars). The last hopes of humanity are
            increasingly placed in the results of explorers, who bravely delve
            deep into the space between galaxys. Earth's days are limited, may
            we find our salvation among the stars. In Obscurum!{" "}
